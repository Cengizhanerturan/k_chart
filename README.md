# k_chart

I developed the ***"k_chart"*** library, currently available on pub.dev, in line with my needs and wanted to share it with you.

### Some of the improvements made

- All the necessary parameters were made to be imported from outside.
- Actions to interact with the chart were arranged, for example; Click, drag, long press actions have been adjusted.
- Bugs in the library have been fixed.
- Design improvements have been made.
